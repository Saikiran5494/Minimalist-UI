        Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of
        young kids who wanted to show mastery in their choosen fields, but were
        directed towards a factory for the daily wages. Each cracker brust
        brighter than lost smiles, and can be heared louder than their cries for
        miles. Buy them, brust them, brag about them.{" "}
